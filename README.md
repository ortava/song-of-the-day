# SOTD - Song of the Day (working title)

### Description: 
SOTD - Song of the Day (working title) is a mobile application that integrates with music streaming service APIs to recommend one song per day.

### Purpose (App):
I spend a lot of time listening to music on Spotify. I've always appreciated it's capability to introduce me to music I would never have heard without it. However, the abundance of recommendations given by Spotify and other music streaming services can make it so that they become daunting to explore, and sometimes the recommendations you want are seemingly impossible to find, especially if you just want to get to the music.

SOTD will drip-feed you song recommendations so that you might be more willing to actually give them a listen. It's like these songs were chosen just for you.

SOTD will give you a higher degree of control over the song recommendations you receive through a voting system (up-vote a song to get more like it, down-vote to get less like it) and app settings (toggle genres, prioritize certain sounds, tempos, lengths).

SOTD is a simple app that allows you to deepen you current music tastes and develop new tastes.

### Purpose (Developer):

I am using the development of this app to work on my software design, testing, and DevOps skills and knowledge. I am writing requirements, use cases, diagrams, and the like. I am also getting experience producing a mobile application from the ground up. I am treating this as a learning exercise while trying to make the best product I can.

### Ongoing Development

SOTD is in the design stage as of writing this (1/9/2023), and is subject to pretty major changes from the name to aspects of the concept.

* I am considering increasing the number of songs recommended per day to three or five. One song per day may be too limited. No more than five though, as the limiting factor of SOTD is part of the purpose.

* Both Android and iOS versions of the app are planned, however focus will be on the completion of the Android version.

* Both Spotify API and Apple Music API integration are planned, however focus will be on integrating the Spotify API.
