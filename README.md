# Song of the Day - SOTD (in-development)

### What is SOTD?
Song of the Day - SOTD is a mobile application that serves the user one song recommendation per day by integrating with music streaming service APIs.

### Why use SOTD?
SOTD helps you discover and develop your taste in music via the hand of fate. When handed a single song, you might be more likely to give it an earnest listen than if you had to wade through a sea of recommendations on a streaming service app.

SOTD also allows you to nudge your recommendations in various directions with its voting system (up-vote a song to get more like it, down-vote to get less like it) and in-app settings (toggle genres, prioritize certain sounds, styles, tempos, lengths).

### Ongoing Development Context
This application is still in development.

I'm treating this project as a learning exercise to improve on areas of software development that I'm particularly weak in. Therefore, I'm focusing on **developer documentation, testing, and general organizational skills**. At the same time, I'm trying to make the best product I can.

Design documents and developer journal contents are included in the repo for demonstrative purposes.
