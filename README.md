# Song of the Day - SOTD (in-development)

### What is SOTD?
Song of the Day - SOTD is an Android mobile application that serves the user one song recommendation per day via integration with the Spotify Web API.

### Why use SOTD?
SOTD helps you discover and develop your taste in music via the hand of fate. When handed a single song, you might be more likely to give it an earnest listen than if you had to wade through a sea of recommendations on Spotify.

SOTD also allows you to nudge your recommendations in various directions via in-app settings where you can toggle genres and prioritize certain sounds, styles, tempos, and durations.
