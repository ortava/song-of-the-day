### Journal Contents

What types of notes will you find in this journal?
_**The stucture of this journal is subject to change as I find what works best for me.**_

* ##### Entries
A place for structured notes that paint a detailed picture of my progress with the project. Each entry should describe my thought process during what I consider to be a significant unit of progress in the development of the project.

* ##### Misc.
A place for structured non-entry notes on particular topics. If a topic is too big and/or important to put in an Entry, this is where a dedicated note will go.

* ##### Thoughts
A place for non-structured non-entry notes on whatever I want. This is where I can let my mind run free with zero expectations for format or quality.

* ##### References
A list of links to external references that I use. 
(Note format help, project GitHub repo, etc.)
